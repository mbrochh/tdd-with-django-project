# Test Driven Development with Django Projects

This is the code of my PyCon APAC 2012 talk about test driven development with
Django projects.

Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/u/mbrochh/p/tdd-with-django

There is a another repository that covers the code for reusable apps:
[https://github.com/mbrochh/tdd-with-django-reusable-app](https://github.com/mbrochh/tdd-with-django-reusable-app)

I have added many comments into the code of that repository that are also valid
for this repository, so please check that repository as well, as I don't want
to repeat myself here.
